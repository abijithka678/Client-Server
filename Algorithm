TCP as the transport layer protocol is used to implement client-server communication utilising socket programming.

Client

1.Make a Socket

2. Establish a connection with the server.

3.Read data from standard input and deliver it to the server using socket programming.

4.Read from the socket and display the results on the standard output

5.Stop



Server

1.Construct a Listening Socket

2.Utilize the socket Programming to connect the IP and Port Address.

3.A socket is listening for incoming client requests.

4.When an incoming request arrives, it accepts it. 

5.When it returns accept, a connection socket is formed.

6.Read data from the client via the connection socket 

7.Put it on the standard input.

8.Turn off the connection socket.

9.Turn off the listening device.
